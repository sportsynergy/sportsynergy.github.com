When advertising for events at the club such as tournaments, leagues, really anything where you want people to sign up, Club Events are a handy way to do it. With Sportsynergy, these can be advertised right on the main screen. Now the way that it worked before is that members could just sign up, but there wasn't a way to sign up with a partner or even specify a division. Well now there is.


### Here is how it works:

When creating the club event, administrators now have the option to specify whether or not they want to have people register with a partner or a division. If you check both of these options members will be able to pick a partner and a division when signing up for the event, like this.
