					<p class="editable">I have used Sportsynergy software for over 10 years, Adam is a pleasure to deal with and is always available to discuss updates and improvements to the site. I have looked into other programs but none of them match the functionality that Sportsynergy brings to the table. From a member standpoint it is extremely user friendly with features like score reporting, ranking updates and find a game emails that keep my court rocking. I highly recommend trying it out if you are planning to switch programs or starting a new club.</p>
